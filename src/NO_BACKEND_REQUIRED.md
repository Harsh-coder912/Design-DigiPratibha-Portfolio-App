# 🚫 NO BACKEND REQUIRED

## DigiPratibha is Frontend-Only

This application **DOES NOT** require any backend services including Supabase.

### ✅ What Works:
- Complete React frontend application
- Mock data for all functionality
- localStorage for user sessions
- Portfolio builder with templates
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- AI features (simulated responses)
- Career tools and job matching
- Dark/light theme switching
- Responsive design

### ❌ What's Disabled:
- Supabase edge functions (causing 403 errors)
- Database connections
- Real authentication
- File storage
- Real-time features

### 🔧 Deployment:
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Deploy `build/` folder to any static hosting
3. No backend configuration needed
4. App works immediately

### 🐛 If You See Errors:
- **Ignore Supabase 403 errors** - they don't affect functionality
- **Use "Safe Mode"** if loading issues occur
- **Clear browser storage** to reset state
- **All features work with mock data**

**This is intentional - the app demonstrates full functionality without requiring actual backend infrastructure.**
